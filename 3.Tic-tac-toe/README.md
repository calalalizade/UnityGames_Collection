## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where the objective is to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal on a 3x3 grid. In this Unity-based version of the game, you can play against a formidable AI opponent that employs the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning. The AI is designed to make optimal moves, making it incredibly challenging to beat.

## Features

- Player vs. unbeatable AI gameplay.
- The AI is powered by the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for optimal decision-making.
- Beautifully rendered 2D game board.
- Clear indicators for player turns and game results.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/calalalizade/UnityGames_Collection/releases) section of this repository. Then follow these steps:

1. Download the game executable for your platform (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

2. Run the downloaded executable to start the game.

3. Enjoy the game and have fun trying to outsmart the unbeatable AI!

## AI Implementation

The AI in this game utilizes the powerful Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to ensure it always makes optimal moves. Here's an overview of how it works:

### Minimax Algorithm

The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games like Tic-Tac-Toe. It evaluates all possible game states to determine the best move for the current player. The basic concept is to maximize the player's score while minimizing the opponent's score.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning

To optimize the Minimax algorithm's search and reduce the number of evaluated game states, Alpha-Beta Pruning is employed. This technique efficiently prunes branches of the game tree that cannot lead to a better outcome, saving computational resources.

The combination of Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning makes the AI unbeatable. It evaluates all possible moves to find the best one, ensuring that the game remains a challenging experience for players.

The AI's source code and detailed implementation can be found in the project's scripts.
