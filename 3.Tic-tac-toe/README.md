Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where the objective is to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal on a 3x3 grid. In this Unity-based version of the game, you can play against a formidable AI opponent that employs the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning. The AI is designed to make optimal moves, making it incredibly challenging to beat.

## Features

- Player vs. unbeatable AI gameplay.
- The AI is powered by the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for optimal decision-making.
- Beautifully rendered 3D game board.
- Clear indicators for player turns and game results.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/calalalizade/UnityGames_Collection/releases) section of this repository. Then follow these steps:

2. Run the downloaded executable to start the game.

3. Enjoy the game and have fun trying to outsmart the unbeatable AI!

## AI Implementation

The unbeatable AI in this game is powered by the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making algorithm widely used in two-player games like Tic-Tac-Toe. Alpha-Beta Pruning is implemented to optimize the search for the best move. This combination ensures the AI always makes the best possible move, making it exceptionally challenging to defeat.

The AI's source code and implementation details can be found in the project's scripts.
