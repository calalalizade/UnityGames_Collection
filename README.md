# UnityGames_Collection

Welcome to the Unity Games Collection repository! This repository contains a variety of small games that I've created for learning and experimentation purposes using the Unity game development engine. Please note that these games are not polished products and are primarily intended for educational purposes.

## License

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE), which means you can use, modify, and distribute the code for both personal and commercial purposes. However, please keep in mind that the games in this collection are provided as-is and without any warranty.

## Disclaimer

These games are experimental and may contain bugs and unfinished features. They are not meant for production use or as polished, complete games. Feel free to use them as a learning resource or a starting point for your own projects.

Happy gaming and learning! If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to me at [mail](mailto:celal.alizade.0000@gmail.com).
